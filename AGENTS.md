# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/` contains the NestJS application code (controllers, modules, services).
- `test/` holds end-to-end tests and Jest e2e config (`test/jest-e2e.json`).
- `prisma/schema.prisma` defines the database schema; `prisma.config.ts` wires `DATABASE_URL`.
- `db/` and `generated/` are reserved for local database assets and generated outputs.
- Top-level config lives in `.prettierrc`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `tsconfig*.json`, and `nest-cli.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm run start` runs the app with the Nest CLI.
- `npm run start:dev` runs in watch mode for local development.
- `npm run start:debug` starts the app with the Node inspector attached.
- `npm run build` compiles the TypeScript project to `dist/`.
- `npm run start:prod` runs the compiled app from `dist/`.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint with autofix on `src/`, `apps/`, `libs/`, `test/`.
- `npm run format` formats `src/**/*.ts` and `test/**/*.ts` with Prettier.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript is the primary language; keep modules and providers small and focused.
- Use single quotes and trailing commas per `.prettierrc`.
- ESLint is configured in `eslint.config.mjs` with Prettier integration.
- Test files use the `*.spec.ts` naming convention.

## Testing Guidelines

- Unit tests run with Jest via `npm run test` and follow `*.spec.ts` under `src/`.
- E2E tests run with `npm run test:e2e` and live in `test/`.
- Coverage reports are generated by `npm run test:cov` to `coverage/`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- This repository has no git commits yet, so there is no established commit style.
- Use concise, imperative commit subjects (e.g., "Add auth module").
- PRs should include a clear summary, testing notes, and linked issues when applicable.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Store secrets in `.env` and wire `DATABASE_URL` for Prisma.
- Do not commit `.env` or generated artifacts unless explicitly required.
